Assumptions-
1. Compliance users are the ones who can create/edit/view/delete guidelines. We are assuming that one
compliance user can edit/delete other compliance users guidelines as well.
2. For simplicity, we will assume that once the guidelines are marked as passed/failed against a content, the reviewer can not change it again. The content author has to create a fresh content again.
3. For general public readers, the only the content which are passed, will be visible.
