Assumptions-
1. Compliance users are the ones who can create/edit/view/delete guidelines. We are assuming that one
compliance user can edit/delete other compliance users guidelines as well.
2. For simplicity, we will assume that once the guidelines are marked as passed/failed against a content, the reviewer can not change it again. The content author has to create a fresh content again.
3. For general public readers, or any user other than the creator other and reviewers, only the content which are PASSED, will be visible in GET apis.
4. If no guidelines exist in our db at the time of creation of a content, we will make it PASSED, once it is submitted. If guidelines are added later on, it would not change the status of content.
